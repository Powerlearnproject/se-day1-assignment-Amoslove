# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

ANSWER:software engineering is an engineering branch that is associated with the development of software,
using a well defined scientific principles,methods and procedure, such as analysis,design,implementation,deployment and maitainance.
in other words it is the art and science of designing, building(using code) and maintaining software solutions that solves real world problem



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

ANSWERE:agile methogologies,oop(object-oriented programming) and structured programming



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

ANSWERE: the life cycle of software development are as follows:
1. idea generation:getting an idea on how to solve a  particular problem.
2. planning: here time and resource reqired,the gaol of the project,the budget and the project scop
3. requirement Analysis:getting the detailed reqirememt,information, funtionalities that are reqired by to solve that problem.
4. design:here you creat the user interface design, creating software design,how you want your software solution to look like(software architecture)
5. development: here you build your already created design  with code and bringing it to live.
6. testing: you test your developed software product to identify bugs and ensure the functionality meets reqirement
7. deployment: here the software product is distributed to its users
8. maintainance: adding new features after deployment and checking and fixing bugs

   


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
